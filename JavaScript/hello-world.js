/*
    JavaScript is a very powerful language, but it is also a quirky language. All the resources
    needed for OOP are present, but if you just need to create a small script or test some functionality
    without all the overhead of working with OOP you can do more functional programming as well. The
    strength of JavaScript is its flexibility, but this does mean you have to be aware of some of
    the quirks of the language.

    Weak typing: the type of the variables you create are not set in stone: the compiler may auto
                 coerce the type of your variable at runtime to keep your code from crashing
    dynamically types: variables do not need to have their declared when you create them. the type
                       is determined at runtime and can change on the fly
    Interpreted language: code is compiled and executed line by line: this allows for faster prototyping
                         and easier script creation, but means you don't get the benefit of compile-time
                         checks
