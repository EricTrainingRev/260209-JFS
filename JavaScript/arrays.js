/*
    JavaScript arrays are flexible data structures that can hold data and mix and match the
    types of that data in whatever flexible way you need. This makes them useful for quick
    iteration and grouping, but because of their flexible nature you do need to take care when
    writing your code that you are aware of what types you pass into your arrays so that you
    are not trying to call invalid methods or perform invalid actions on the data
