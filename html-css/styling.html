            When you need to apply batch styling you can use internal styling: to do this you
            declare a style tag and then put your styling information as content between the
            opening and closing tags. The format for this is:
            selector { propertyOne: vale; propertyTwo: value; etc... }

        /* 
            All web elements have access to style properties: some of these affect the visuals of
            the element being rendered, others provide metadata that the browser and other elements
            can use in order to make your web page functional. These properties, when managed 
            correctly, can take your webpage and its look to professional heights.

            If you ever need to target a single element for styling you can always use an
            Id selector. This tells the browser to apply the styling to whatever element has
            the given Id attribute. Keep in mind there is no enforcement of unique ids when
            assigned to elements; if multiple elements have the same id they will all be given
            the same styling.

            By default, the text-size property of the html element is set to 16 px. This starting
            value sets the default for your relative units of measurement. You have two special
            values for making relative units:
            em -> similar to the rem unit, this option sets your value relative to the text size of
                  either the element it is being applied to or to the parent element.
            rem -> rem is a unit of measurement that works off the text size of the html element. You
                   can use this option to help scale the size of any styling property you want to have
                   relative to the text size of the page.

            You can also use percentages as a relative unit of measurement. This will be relative
            to the resource being augmented: for instance, in the example below the elements
            given the class of halfway will have their width set to half of the viewport

            Sometimes it is the relationship between your elements that will determine what styling
            you want to apply to the elements. You can use these relationships between elements
            without needing to create extra classes for any base styling you want to apply. In
            the example below all child list item elements of ordered list elements have their
            color property set to "blueviolet". This can be quicker for setting your baseline
            styling than creating classes and applying them where needed.

            You can use psuedo-classes when you need to conditionally apply styling to an element
            based on criteria that is determined outside of the DOM. For the example below, the
            element with the given id has its color property set to "hotpink" when the mouse
            hovers over it. This has nothing to do with the structure of the dom, it is controlled
            by the user's mouse movement

            target specific aspects of the element being affected. In the example below the element
            with the given id will have the color of the first letter in its text content set to
            "blueviolet"

        Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) is the standard way of applying styling to your web pages. The
        "cascading" part of the name comes from the fact that styling applied to parent elements
        is applied (when it can be) to child elements. This is also an example of inline styling: this
        is where you directly within the element via its style attribute set its styling information.
        This is quick and easy, but should not be done for large applications or when you expect to
        make revisions in the future due to needing to make adjustments for all places where you have
        set up inline styling. It is hard to maintain.

        <!-- 
            Note that even though the p element below has no styling directly applied to it when it
            is rendered in the browser the text is red. This is because the parent element, the div,
            has the red color styling property assigned to it, which cascades down to the descendant
            paragraph element. This feature makes it much easier to keep your styling organized and
            makes it easier not to need to repeat your style applications.
