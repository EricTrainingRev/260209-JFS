            Another way to make your web page more reactive is to use media queries to conditionally
            style elements on your page based upon the media tool being used. For the example below, 
            the text of the paragraph element will be colored green when the width of the viewport is 
            600px or less. You could combine this with a height check to create "mobile" styling
            for your web page, or something similar
