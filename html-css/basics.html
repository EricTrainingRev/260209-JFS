    <!-- 
        At the core of all web pages is Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML). Browsers read the HTML
        of your web page and use the syntax of the page to determine how to render the web page
        for you. In doing so he browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) that is a virtual
        representation of the HTML content of the web page. It is the DOM that is actually rendered
        and shown to the user, which allows for dynamic web pages to display unique data and media
        to users without the core page itself being overwritten by everyone trying to access the page
    -->

    <!-- 
        When writing your HTML you write tags to represent the web elements that need to be
        rendered on your page. These tags can have an opening and closing tag like the head and
        body tags on this page, or they can be self-closing tags, like the meta tags on this
        page. These tags are read by the browser and then the browser adds the elements that
        correlate to these tags to the DOM.
    -->

    <!-- 
        When adding content to your web page the easiest way to do so is to write out the tags
        and put any content you want included between the tags (assuming you are working with
        an opening and closing tag)
    -->
    <p>
        Any text content I want to add to the page can be stored between an opening and closing
        p tag. This is not the only web element that can store text, but it is a common one.
    </p>

    <!-- 
        a self-closing tag example. In this img element we have added some attributes to the
        element: the src attribute tells the browser where to find the image to display in the
        img element, the alt attribute tells the browser what text to show if the image 
        declared in the src attribute is not found (think bad link, new location, etc.). These
        attributes are a way of augmenting your elements to make them render/work the way you
        want.

    <!-- 
        Elements fall in to two categories: inline and block elements.

        Block elements get rendered on the page on their own line. What this means is the element
        will take up all of the width of the viewport when it gets rendered, so if two block
        elements are declared in your html one after another they will each render on their own
        "line" of the page.

        Inline elements only take up as much width as they need, so inline elements can be rendered
        next to each other instead of on separate lines. It is common to see inline elements 
        declared inside of block elements for grouping purposes

            in <span>this text</span> paragraph
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 
        A versatile element to get comfortable with is the input element: this is the standard
        element that allows users to provide some input to the webpage; this can be text, numbers, files,
        dates, colors, etc. No matter what kind of input you want to allow for the user the tag and
        the attributes you will use to set this up will be consistent
